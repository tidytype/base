# 🪣📖 Tidytype
An open source library for making text legible and readable from digital screens 📱 to physical paper 📰

### 🤔 Why are we doing this?
We have not found technology that provides a good implementation of typographic rules in a digital and physical context for long form content. We want to enable anyone to create and consume written content in the best possible way. Great typography is not just about font-selection and some colors, but how the text is broken up, emphasized, highlighted, and even how references are tied into the content you are reading.

### 💪 Movable, scalable and portable type
We want to create one set of definitions that will work across all platforms, digital as well as in physical formats.

### ⛺️ Native to its media
