# 🪣📖 Tidytype
An open source library for making text legible and readable from digital screens 📱 to physical paper 📰

### 🤔 Why are we doing this?
We have not found technology that provides a good implementation of typographic rules in a digital and physical context for long form content. We want to enable anyone to create and consume written content in the best possible way. Great typography is not just about font-selection and some colors, but how the text is broken up, emphasized, highlighted, and even how references are tied into the content you are reading.

### 💪 Movable, scalable and portable type
We want to create one set of definitions that will work across all platforms, digital as well as in physical formats.

### ⛺️ Native to its media
- Light vs. dark mode
- Landscape vs. portrait
- Pages, breaks & spreads

### 🍱 Rich as in html
- Bold & emphasis
- Deletion & strike-troughs
- Marks & highlights
- Links & references
- Attribution & abbreviation
- Quotes & sources
- Figures, tables, links and illustrations integrated easily

### 💯 Structured texts to structured layouts
- Tidytype's typographic library ensures consistent readability across platforms. (Under development).
- Responsive grids keep content in place, while smart styles promote relaxed reading, from skimming to thorough reading
- Playful navigation through long content
- Intelligent cross referencing, lists and notes
- (Optional) Pagination to break the scroll-habit
– Margins that pleases the eyes (and neck)

## 😪 Help us help you read!
- Our development aims to share our research and code through an open source initiative (governed under an MIT licence), so that readability can again take centre stage online and elsewhere.
- Designers, developers, publishers and readers alike: With your help, we're hoping to design, develop and share this stripped-down way of displaying type online, intellegently and legibly.
- Help us both combine existing and develop new solutions to this decade-old problem.
- If print is dead anyway, why also kill the joy of reading?

## 💁 Input from anywhere
- Markdown support
